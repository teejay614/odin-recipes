    <h2>
      A true classic that is also an easy dish to make for your kids for lunch.
    </h2>
    <p>
      You cannot go wrong with a grilled cheese sandwich. Every bite feels
      patriotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love pairing this with tomato soup, or chicken noodle soup with a soda
      on the side.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 slices of white bread</li>
      <li>1 sliced cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Butter the bread on one side and place the bread butter-side down on a
        hot skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with cheese, then place another slice of bread on top (butter-side
        up).
      </li>
      <li>Cook until the bottom slice is lightly browned, then flip.</li>
      <li>Continue cooking until the cheese is melted.</li>
    </ol>
