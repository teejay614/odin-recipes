# odin-recipes

This is my submission with TOP where I went through the lesson plan and built out a website that has three of my favorite recipes.


What I learned while going through the lesson:
1. Github as a really nice tool for Git
2. Learning more about Git and how important and meaningful it is to have a subject and message.
3. Learning more about how the web works and how to build out a structure for HTML. I really enjoyed how Visual Studio has boilerplate shortcut
4. I really enjoyed learning more about keeping hands on the keyboard and interacting with the terminal more. I enjoyed using touch to create files and mv to move image files I downloaded into my project, and rmv -r to remove files I made by mistake.

I am ready to create more and work on becoming better at full stack development!
